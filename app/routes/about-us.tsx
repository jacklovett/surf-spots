                Surf Spots was created by a passionate surfer who wanted a way
                to keep track of the spots he has exlored around the world.
                Where I have surfed, which countries and continents etc. I
                thought maybe there were like minded surfers out there, so as a
                solo developer, I built this platform to make it easier for
                everyone to discover and enjoy surfing.
